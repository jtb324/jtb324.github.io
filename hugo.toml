content = "I am a PhD student in the Human Genetics Program at Vanderbilt University. My research focuses on how we can leverage distant relatedness in large biobanks linked to electronic health data to explore the genetic causes of disease. To investigate this, I design workflows and software in (*mostly*) python and R for both local HPC environments and the cloud using Terra.bio. Additionally, I have an interest in how we can leverage modern high performance data science packages such as Polars and DuckDB to increase the scalability of many genomic workflows to accommodate the large biobanks such as BioVU, All of Us, and UK Biobank."
